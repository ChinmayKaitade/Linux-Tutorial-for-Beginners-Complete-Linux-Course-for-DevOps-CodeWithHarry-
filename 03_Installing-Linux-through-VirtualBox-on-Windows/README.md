# 📦 **Installing Linux Through VirtualBox on Windows**

Running Linux inside Oracle VM VirtualBox is the safest local sandbox to experiment without affecting Windows. 🧪

It allows you to test risky system configurations, network bridging, and bash scripts completely isolated. 🔒

Follow this local hypervisor setup to get an Ubuntu virtual machine running smoothly on your machine. 🚀

## 📥 **Prerequisites & Downloads**

- **🧰 Oracle VM VirtualBox:** Download and install the latest VirtualBox for Windows along with the Extension Pack.
- **💿 Ubuntu ISO Image:** Download the official **Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS** (or Ubuntu Server) `.iso` file.
- **⚙️ Hardware Virtualization (VT-x / AMD-V):** Ensure Virtualization Technology is enabled inside your Windows Task Manager (`Performance > CPU`) or motherboard BIOS/UEFI.

## 🖥️ **Virtual Machine Configuration**

- **1. Create New VM:** Open VirtualBox, click **New**, name it `Ubuntu-DevOps`, and select the downloaded ISO image.
- **2. Allocate Resources:**
  - **🧠 RAM:** Assign at least **4 GB (4096 MB)** (or 2 GB minimum for Server).
  - **⚙️ CPU:** Assign at least **2 vCPUs** to keep the guest OS responsive.
- **3. Virtual Hard Disk:** Allocate a dynamically allocated virtual hard disk of **25 GB to 30 GB**.
- **4. Complete OS Installation:** Boot the VM, follow the on-screen Ubuntu installer prompts, set your username and password, and reboot when finished.

## 🔌 **Post-Install Optimizations**

- **🧩 Install Guest Additions:** From the VirtualBox menu, click **Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image...** to unlock shared clipboards, drag-and-drop, and full-screen auto-resizing.
- **🌐 Network Setup (Bridged vs. NAT):**
  - Keep **NAT** for simple outbound internet access.
  - Switch to **Bridged Adapter** under `Settings > Network` if you want your local router to give your VM its own IP address on your home Wi-Fi/LAN.
